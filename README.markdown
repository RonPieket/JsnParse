Why another JSON library?
=========================

There are a zillion JSON libraries out there. Why add zillion-and-one?

Many of the existing JSON libraries use STL containers. The remaining libraries use their own internal containers. JsonByoc uses *your* containers.

Practically every game development company that I know has developed their own container classes.
